I'm a full-stack web developer currently working at [Attentive](https://attentive.com), a B2B company in the rapidly growing SMS marketing space. I work primarily in Java, Python and Typescript.

Although I've been building websites for ages (geocities.com, IYKYK), my first career was as a science journalist. I loved getting to ask smart people about black holes, rare animals, and the inner workings of the brain. In 2021, I shifted gears and taught myself web development. In early 2022, I started my second act.

I love trying new things and solving big problems, but I also have found I love the little things:

- writing unit tests
- finally finding and fixing that one annoying bug
- creating great design docs

I've led projects to build features from scratch (a login system now used by 1,000+ clients, rebuilding an Airflow job to take advantage of its built-in concurrency and shorten a job's processing time from 6 hours to 6 minutes) and also gotten to work under brilliant senior engineers to improve existing products.

I'm also active as an organizer in [Women & Gender eXpansive Coders DC](https://www.meetup.com/women-and-gender-expansive-coders-dc-wgxc-dc/), a local tech group for women and nonbinary people in tech, and on the leadership committee for Attentive Women in Engineering, Attentive's ERG, where I plan and host events like brag workshops (inspired by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/)), speaker series, and social get-togethers.

I have a [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelkaufman13/) that you might be interested in visiting (note: I do not accept connections from strangers without VERY good introductory messages), as well as a [Github](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachelkaufman13/).
