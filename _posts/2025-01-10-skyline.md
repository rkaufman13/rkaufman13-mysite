![It's my github skyline, rendered as ASCII art.](/assets/skyline-2024.png)

This is always a bit of silly fun, but I missed it last year. This year, the Github team put together a [CLI tool](https://github.com/github/gh-skyline) that somewhat replicates the old STL generator. I used to print mine out, but I think I like the ASCII art better. :)

This was created in late 2024, but I don't think I had too many commits at the end of the year. That big gap early in the year was jury duty (oof).
