Frequent visitors to the site may have noticed some minor layout changes around here.

I've moved my list of projects to the top of the main page. Crucially, it is now mobile friendly as well.

Projects also have tags on them now to distinguish between `apps` (something that may be useful), `games` (a full-fledged, playable game) and `toys` (things I made to mess around with). I may add more categories later.

On the backend, projects are now a Jekyll `Collection` which in theory gives me more control over how to render them. And, if you reshare any of my posts, they now have improved open graph metadata.
