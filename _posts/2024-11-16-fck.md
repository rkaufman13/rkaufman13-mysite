Dunno how y'all are feeling lately, but I just have a lot of curse words on my mind. And by complete coincidence (actually no really), continuing with my theme of [terminal tricks]({%post_url 2024-08-14-command-line %}) I have discovered the most perfectly named, magnificent app: [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck). It corrects your previous console command. All you have to do is install it and type: `fuck`.

Here's an example that I have already used (twice):

```bash
➜ git push
fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master


➜ fuck
git push --set-upstream origin master [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Counting objects: 9, done.
```

(And yes I've done `git config --global push.autoSetupRemote true` but I just got a new work computer argh)

It also works on typos:

```bash
➜ git stats
git: 'stats' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
The most similar command is
         status
➜ fuck
git status [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
```

I suppose I could make aliases for all my common typos but this is way easier. Also, it's fun to type swears in the terminal.

It auto-configures itself after you install it and type `fuck` the first time, and even can configure itself with `fish` (which I'm trying out on my work computer). Also, have I mentioned it's fun to type swear words?
