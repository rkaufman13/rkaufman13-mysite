I would like to be writing more, and most self-help books about productivity say the same thing: If you'd like to encourage a good habit, you need to remove friction.
To that end I'm trying out a few portable Bluetooth keyboards, under the idea that if it is easier to type on my phone on the go, I will type more on my phone on the go.

The Arteck that I borrowed from my husband is just okay. I am typing on it right now, and it wobbles a little on my lap, and makes quite a ruckus as I bang away on the keys. It is also a little on the large side for stowing in a purse, although it's light as a feather and so would be easy to toss in a larger bag. I have high hopes for the Plugable folding keyboard, which Redditors recommend, and which I grabbed on eBay (but has not yet arrived).

Either way, one of these should make it easier to at least draft thoughts. I'm sure I'll publish them from a laptop.

Now to find out if I have anything to say...
