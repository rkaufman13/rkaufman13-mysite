[Infinite Queens](https://rkaufman13.github.io/infinite-queens/) is a clone of an old puzzle called Queens, in which the goal is to place eight queens on a chessboard so that none can capture each other in one move. The original puzzle gives players a blank board; I've placed some starting pieces so that each game forces the player to come up with a (hopefully) novel solution.

Play it [here](https://rkaufman13.github.io/infinite-queens/).
