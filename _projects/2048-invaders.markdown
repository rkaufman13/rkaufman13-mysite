[2048 Invaders](https://megara133.itch.io/2048-invaders) is a math-themed space shooter. The goal is to reach 2048 by hitting matching powers of 2. Hit two 2s in a row, and they will become 4. Hit two 4s, they will become 8. And so on. I'm not sure if it's possible to beat this game, as I haven't managed to make it past 256.

I was inspired to enter the [Github Game Off](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023) for the first time this year, when the theme was announced: _Scale_. This immediately made me think of a practice, unfinished game I made in Phaser.js in 2021, so I dusted it off and finished it for the jam. I don't know if "games you started making two years ago but only got as far as making the sprites move" count as entries to the jam, but I wasn't going to win anyway--there are some insanely talented people participating. So this was mostly to see if I could do it, and dust off my Javascript class patterns.

The game is available to play for free in-browser at [Itch](https://megara133.itch.io/2048-invaders), but it's more performant if you [pull the repo and play locally](https://github.com/rkaufman13/2048-invaders). I'm going to experiment with packaging it as an Electron app at some point to see if that improves the feel of the controls. But it's.... fun? Or at least I think so.
