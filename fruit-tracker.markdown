Most Americans do not eat enough fruit and vegetables, and I am among them. However, detailed food tracking has never worked for me. It's too much work, and quite frankly, I don't care exactly how many calories I'm taking in, or milligrams of salt or whatever. I just want to know, in a general sense, what did I eat today and was it good for me?

That was my inspiration behind [Fruit Tracker](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/74375fbf-752f-4ead-8d08-72293e63082a), which is a dead-simple Fitbit app. Turn it on after you've had a banana or a salad, estimate how many servings of fruit and veg it represents, and tap the counter to increase (or decrease) your serving count.

The counter remembers how many fruits and vegetables you ate for a day, and then resets. That's it.

I use this now in conjunction with the FOSS app [Loop Habit Tracker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.isoron.uhabits&hl=en_US). A popup appears at 8am every morning asking "how many fruits and vegetables did you eat yesterday?" and my wrist now tells me.

In truth, this could be used for anything that you want to track daily, as long as the quantity is single-digits and you don't mind the icon being an apple. There are already some lovely [water](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/a845c4b2-e667-4b8e-ab7a-82375eafd0b3) apps for Fitbit, but maybe you want to track the number of times you took a stretch break during the workday? Or the number of miles you hike? (Of course, if you have a Fitbit it probably already knows your distance).

[Fruit Tracker](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/74375fbf-752f-4ead-8d08-72293e63082a) is available, free, on the Fitbit Gallery for Sense, Versa 2 and Versa 3 (for as long as the Gallery remains open).
